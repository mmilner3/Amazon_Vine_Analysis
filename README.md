# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the difference in rating percentages for paid and non paid reviews. Specifcally we are looking to see if there is a bias when reviews are paid for. 

## Results 
I Assessed both paid and unpaid reviews to look at the ratios of 5 star reviews to non 5 star reviews. 

paid reviews:

Paid reviews showed 48% 5 star reviews and 26 4 star reviews 


Non paid reviews:

unpaid reviews showed 38% 5 star reviews and 16% 4 star reviews 

Based on this information we can conclude that there is infact bias 
that comes from reviews being paid

one additional analysis that we could perform would be the amount of paid reviews vs non paid revies to understand how much more likley a paid review is to come through compared to a non paid review.
